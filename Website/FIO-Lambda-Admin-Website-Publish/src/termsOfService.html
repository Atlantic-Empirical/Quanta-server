Subscription Fee changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the Subscription Fee change. You accept the new fees by continuing to use the Quanta Platform and Services after the fee change takes effect. If you do not agree with the applicable price change, you have the right to reject the change by terminating your Quanta Account in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.</span></p>

You understand and agree that the Services are not sponsored or endorsed by any third parties accessible through the Quanta Platform. Flow is not responsible for any payment processing errors or fees or other Services-related issues, including those issues that may arise from inaccurate Account Information.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">d. &nbsp;User Content Representations.

Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to remove any material that Flow, in its sole discretion, finds to be in violation of these Terms and Conditions or otherwise objectionable, and you are solely responsible for the User Content that you post to our Services. &nbsp;Moreover, Flow may terminate one&rsquo;s ability to submit User Content if, under appropriate circumstances, a person submitting the content to the Quanta Platform is determined to be a repeat infringer and/or repeatedly violates the below User Conduct requirements.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span>f</span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;Required Disclosures. You acknowledge and agree that Flow may store and/or preserve User Content and may also disclose User Content and/or other information provided by you if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the terms of these Terms and Conditions; (c) respond to claims that any User Content violates the rights of third-parties in accordance with these Terms and Conditions; and/or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Flow, its representatives and/or agents, its users or the public.</span></p>

          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Flow employs third parties in order to provide its Services to you. Third party services are used to, among other things: verify your identity, speed up and streamline on-boarding, issue cards, process savings transactions, retrieve financial data and aggregate data.

Flow may employ different or additional third parties for these Services from time to time in its sole discretion. &nbsp;In addition, to the extent that Flow is permitted to undertake any action under these Terms and Conditions, you agree that we may permit our third party financial institutions or subcontractors to undertake such action on our behalf.</span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">You agree Flow may access any account you have set up through our third party processor in connection with the Services. We may use that information to in order to provide you with the Quanta Platform and Services, to develop our products and services, and for our internal business purposes.</span></p>

          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">As part of the Quanta Platform, Flow will retrieve information from Your Bank Accounts and your Account Information. Flow works with one or more online financial service providers to access this Account Information. Flow makes no effort to review the Account Information for any purpose, including but not limited to accuracy, legality or non-infringement. Flow is not responsible for the products and services offered by or on third-party sites.</span></p>

Flow cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings. For example, when displayed through the Quanta Platform, Account Information is only as fresh as the time shown, which reflects when the information is obtained from such sites. Such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly from the relevant sites. You can refresh your Account Information through the Quanta Platform, in the manner prescribed in the associated instructions.</span></p>

          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">These Terms and Conditions, and your relationship with Flow under these Terms and Conditions, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of law principles. Any dispute with Flow, or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, arising under or in relation to these Terms and Conditions shall be resolved exclusively through arbitration as set forth in the Section below, except with respect to imminent harm requiring temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in which case Flow may seek such relief in any court with jurisdiction over the parties. You understand that, in return for agreement to this provision, Flow is able to offer the Service at the terms designated. Your assent to this provision is an indispensable consideration to these Terms and Conditions.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">22. Agreement to Arbitrate</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Except for disputes relating to your or Flow&rsquo;s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); you agree that all disputes between You and Flow (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions, the Quanta Platform, the Services, and/or Privacy Policy shall be finally resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator conducted in the English language in California, California, U.S.A. under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), and you and Flow hereby expressly waive trial by jury. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY. &nbsp;You and Flow shall appoint as sole arbitrator a person mutually agreed by you and Flow or, if you and Flow cannot agree within thirty (30) days of either party&rsquo;s request for arbitration, such single arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA upon the request of either party. The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (except that the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator). All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this, application may be made to any court for a judicial acceptance of the award or order of enforcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Flow shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, security or other equitable remedies from the United States District Court of Northern California or any other court of competent jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the arbitrator be authorized to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service or to award punitive damages, including but not limited to pursuant to federal or state statutes permitting multiple or punitive awards.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Any claims brought by You or Flow must be brought in that party&rsquo;s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Neither You nor Flow will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms of Service. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claims related to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You may bring claims only on Your own behalf.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to the arbitration procedures set forth herein (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Flow prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate the arbitration procedures from these Terms of Service, such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms of Service not containing the arbitration procedures is posted to the Website, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Flow prior to the effective date of removal.</span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">These Arbitration provisions will survive the termination of Your relationship with Flow.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">23. Severability</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">If any portion of these Terms and Conditions is deemed invalid, unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, these Terms and Conditions as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of these Terms and Conditions that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from these Terms and Conditions, and that portion deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions; provided, however, the foregoing severability provision does not apply to residents of New Jersey, who are instead subject to the provisions contained in the Legal Notice For New Jersey Residents Section.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">24. Waiver, Survival, and Other Agreements</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">You agree that if Flow does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in these Terms and Conditions, this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Flow&rsquo;s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Flow.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in these Terms and Conditions shall survive your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions and the termination of these Terms and Conditions.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">These Terms and Conditions represent the entire understanding and agreement between you and Flow regarding the subject matter of the same, and supersede all other previous agreements, including any prior version of the Flow Terms and Conditions.</span></p>
